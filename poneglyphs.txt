When Jack and the Beasts Pirates invaded Zou to look for Raizo of Wano Country,
the Mink Tribe chained him to the Road Poneglyph within the Whale Tree to keep him from showing himself.

After Robin deciphered the Road Poneglyph, Inuarashi explained its purpose of revealing the location of Laugh Tale when its information was combined with that of the other three Road Poneglyphs.
